# Travel Platform – Overview

This playbook assumes a mid-sized European travel provider with:

- 3 main channels (web, mobile app, call center),
- ~50 internal users in operations and support,
- several external content and payment providers.

The case study focuses on:
- clarifying the architecture around the Booking Core,
- documenting integration patterns,
- and making trade-offs explicit via ADRs.
