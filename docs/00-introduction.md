# Introduction

This architecture playbook illustrates how I approach structure, clarity and
decision-making in complex IT landscapes.

The scenario is a fictional mid-sized travel provider moving from a
monolithic, batch-driven system to a more modular and event-aware architecture.

The goal is not to document every detail, but to show:
- how to frame goals and constraints,
- how to communicate architecture at different levels,
- and how to capture decisions in a lightweight way.
