# Context and Goals

## Business Context

The travel provider offers:
- package trips,
- dynamic hotel + flight combinations,
- and partner-integrated offers.

The current platform:
- has grown organically,
- mixes core booking logic with UI and integrations,
- and makes changes risky and slow.

## Goals

- Shorten lead time for small changes.
- Decouple booking core from channels (web, app, partners).
- Make ownership and data responsibilities explicit.
- Prepare for more event-driven patterns without a full re-write.
